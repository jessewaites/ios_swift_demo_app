Welcome to my Swift iOS Demo App!
===================


I put this demo together as a way to show interest and perhaps aptitude with Swift / Xcode / iOS Development. This is simply a random fact display app that shows rather benign little facts about me such as the fact that I enjoy eating spaghetti and like to go hiking. 


A few thoughts
-------------

A few things that crossed my mind when building this app.


> - Really neat to see the MVC implementation.

> - Building for iOS in Xcode is a hell of a lot of fun.

> - Adding an app icon for the homepage was a breeze.

> - Adding a launch screen was a total pain.

> - Implementing a button that launched the in-app Safari browser was a breeze.

> - There is no mail client in the simulator so hardcoding an "email me" button into the app may work but will throw an error in Xcode.

> - If I were building an app for, lets say a restaurant, it would be wise to build the menu from an external JSON endpoint, rather than hardcoding everything like meals and prices into the app. This way one could update the menu externally without having to recode the app and go back through the app store submission and review process. This JSON server would probably be great for something like that. https://github.com/typicode/json-server
